###Why is the complexity of binary search O(logN) where N is the size of the list? Explain.

Ans : First of all let's remember what do we understand by time complexity. It is the number of steps or number of iterations that needs to be done to achieve the result what we are looking for in our code. So to find the time complexity of binary search we basically need to count the iteration and as we focus on worst case time complexity so our main task is to find the highest number of iteration in terms of n that can happen while doing binary search and we know that the highest iteration will happen at the worst case and it is when the element doesn't exists in the array.
During every iteration while doing binary search we half the size of the search part of array size. In first iteration the searching area of the array size is n, in second iteration it is n/2, in third iteration it is n/4 and in fourth it is n/8 and so on. There is a pattern here -

1. 1st iteration - n   → n/2^0
2. 2nd iteration - n/2 → n/2^1
3. 3rd iteration - n/4 → n/2^2
4. 4th iteration - n/8 → n/2^3

Our worst case is when we don't find the element in array which we are looking for and that means our searching stops in worst case when our searching area of array size becomes less than 1 means we have less than 1 element to check. Let's imagine that happens in Kth iteration so at that time the array searching area size becomes n/2^K-1. <br/>
So, n/2^K-1 < 1  <br/>
n < 2^K-1 (We can ignore -1 as we don't count constants) <br/>
So, n<2^K <br/>
And finally take 2 to the other side → log n < k which makes the complexity of binary search log(n). <br/>
